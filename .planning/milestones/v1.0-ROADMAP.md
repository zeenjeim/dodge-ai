# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-19
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Dodge AI is a working browser bullet hell game (~4700 lines, single HTML file) with an AI that learns your dodge patterns. This milestone took the existing game from "fun prototype" to "polished, discoverable, sticky product" across 5 phases: tightened the mobile/death experience, deepened the AI's intelligence (the core differentiator), added analytics and shareability for discovery, built daily challenge retention loops, and expanded gameplay with new mechanics. All 19 in-scope v1 requirements were covered (3 streak requirements deferred by user). No backend, no frameworks, no build tooling.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Gameplay Polish
**Goal**: Every death feels earned and mobile play feels native
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: POLISH-01, POLISH-02, POLISH-03, POLISH-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Death context capture, freeze-frame kill indicator, and game-over kill text
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Mobile touch offset, gesture prevention, and safe area integration

**Completed:** 2026-02-18

### Phase 2: AI Intelligence
**Goal**: The AI visibly learns player patterns, adapts its attacks, and stays fair
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (death feedback supports AI transparency — player sees what killed them before AI explains why)
**Requirements**: AI-01, AI-02, AI-03, AI-04, AI-05, AI-06
**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves, sequential — all modify index.html)

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — AI callout toast system, welcome-back taunts, expanded localStorage persistence (wave 1)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — 4 pattern detectors, counter-pattern firing with purple glow, detection/taunt callouts (wave 2)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Threat level controller, adaptive difficulty, endgame cycling, powerup rebalance (wave 3)

**Notable:** Callout toast system was removed per user feedback during 02-03 checkpoint. Brain panel stats replaced personality text.

**Completed:** 2026-02-19

### Phase 3: Growth Foundation
**Goal**: The game is discoverable via search, shareable as a visual card, and measured with analytics
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (AI commentary powers the share card content; AI learning messages create shareable moments)
**Requirements**: GROW-01, GROW-02, GROW-03, GROW-04, GROW-05
**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves, sequential — all modify index.html)

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — SEO foundation: meta tags, OG/Twitter Card, JSON-LD VideoGame, below-fold content section
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Visual share card: 1200x630 canvas-generated PNG with stats and AI commentary
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Analytics: GoatCounter integration with lifecycle events and drop-off tracking

**Completed:** 2026-02-19

### Phase 4: Retention
**Goal**: Daily challenge mode and personal best tracking give players a reason to return
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (analytics data informs whether retention features are working; share card can include daily challenge results)
**Requirements**: RET-01 (RET-02, RET-03, RET-04 deferred by user)
**Plans**: 2 plans (2 waves, sequential -- both modify index.html)

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- Seeded PRNG, swappable rng(), daily challenge mode with button/HUD/game-over
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- Personal best list (localStorage, migration, stats modal, share card daily badge)

**Completed:** 2026-02-19

### Phase 5: New Mechanics
**Goal**: Gameplay stays fresh with new projectile types, environmental hazards, and player abilities
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (AI intelligence must be in place so new projectiles and hazards interact with adaptive difficulty; new abilities must be balanced against AI learning)
**Requirements**: MECH-01, MECH-02, MECH-03
**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves, sequential -- all modify index.html)

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — 3 new projectile types (spiral, cluster, mine) with phase-gated spawning
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — 3 environmental hazards (gravity well, danger zone, arena shrink) with AI-triggered spawning
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — 4 unlockable player abilities (dash, decoy, phase shift, time warp) with milestone progression

**Completed:** 2026-02-19

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Single HTML file architecture maintained through all 5 phases (~4700 lines)
- AI callout toast system built in 02-01, removed in 02-03 per user playtesting feedback
- Powerups rebalanced: removed Plot Armor, Maximum Effort, Yoink; added GTFO dash (8→6)
- Threat level smoothed from original plan values after playtesting (gentler ramp, wider cap window)
- Cosmetic vs gameplay Math.random() separation for daily challenge seed determinism
- toBlob used instead of toDataURL for share card PNG export
- GoatCounter chosen for privacy-first analytics (no cookie consent needed)
- Phase Shift blocks projectiles only, not hazards (intentional gameplay tradeoff)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Death indicator barely visible — fixed with 300ms freeze + dark overlay (01-02 checkpoint)
- Plan pseudo-code referenced non-existent APIs (Particle 'shockwave' type, this.state) — auto-fixed during 05-03 execution

**Issues Deferred:**
- RET-02/03/04 (streak tracking, rewards, ramp-down) — deferred by user, not needed for v1
- GoatCounter account creation — analytics no-ops until real site code replaces DODGEAI placeholder
- OG image placeholder needs real asset

**Technical Debt:**
- ~4700 lines in single HTML file — extraction recommended for future work
- Mine/cluster child kills label as "NORMAL" in death indicator instead of parent type
- Welcome-back taunt data loaded but not surfaced to UI (callout system removed)
- GTFO dash doesn't grant hazard immunity (inconsistency with projectile/boss immunity)
- Daily deaths only fire 'daily-death' analytics event, not per-phase funnel
