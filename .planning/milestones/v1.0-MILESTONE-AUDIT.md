**Score: 19/19 in-scope requirements satisfied**

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Status | All Self-Checks |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1. Gameplay Polish | 2/2 | Complete | PASSED |
| 2. AI Intelligence | 3/3 | Complete | PASSED |
| 3. Growth Foundation | 3/3 | Complete | PASSED |
| 4. Retention | 2/2 | Complete | PASSED |
| 5. New Mechanics | 3/3 | Complete | PASSED |

**Score: 5/5 phases complete, 13/13 plans delivered**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Connection | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Death indicator + Phase 5 projectile types | Connected | Mine/cluster child kills label as "NORMAL" (cosmetic) |
| AI detectors → hazard spawning | Connected | All 4 detectors feed hazard decisions correctly |
| Threat level → new projectile spawns | Connected | Affects speed/density; type probabilities stay per-phase |
| Share card + daily badge | Connected | isDailyChallenge preserved through full flow |
| Analytics + daily deaths | Connected | Daily deaths don't fire per-phase events (minor gap) |
| Seeded PRNG + Phase 5 spawning | Connected | All this.rng() calls covered for spiral/cluster/mine |
| EMP + hazard clearing | Connected | this.hazards = [] in EMP handler |
| Ghost + hazard immunity | Connected | All 3 hazard types check effects.ghost.active |
| Abilities + daily seed | Connected | No this.rng() calls in ability activation |
| Personal bests + new mechanics | Connected | saveBest() called on every death unconditionally |

**Score: 10/10 integration points connected (3 with minor notes)**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Normal game (full loop) | Complete | All 9 projectile types, hazards, abilities, death, share, retry |
| Daily challenge | Complete | Seeded, deterministic, daily best tracked, badge on share card |
| Returning player | Complete | Brain, abilities, bests all restored from localStorage |
| Mobile | Complete | Touch offset, safe areas, gesture prevention, ability button |

**Score: 4/4 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Gameplay Polish
- Mine/cluster child projectile kills display "NORMAL" instead of parent type in death indicator (cosmetic label gap)

### Phase 2: AI Intelligence
- Welcome-back taunt data is loaded and stored (getSavedProfile()) but never surfaced to UI since callout system was removed per user feedback
- GTFO dash powerup doesn't grant hazard immunity while it does grant projectile/boss immunity — inconsistency in immunity model

### Phase 3: Growth Foundation
- GoatCounter account not yet created — all analytics no-op until placeholder replaced
- OG image placeholder needs real asset (could leverage generateShareCard() pattern)
- Daily challenge deaths only fire `daily-death` event, not `death-phase-N` — per-phase funnel broken for daily players

### General
- ~4700 lines in single HTML file — extraction recommended if future work continues

**Total: 7 items across 4 categories. No critical blockers.**

## Execution Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total plans | 13 |
| Total execution time | ~97 min |
| Average per plan | ~7 min |
| Files modified | 1 (index.html) |
| Verification files | 0 (verifier disabled in config) |
| Deviations from plans | 3 minor auto-fixes across all 13 plans |
