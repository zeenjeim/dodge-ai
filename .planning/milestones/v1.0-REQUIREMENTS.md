## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 19 of 22 v1 requirements
**Adjusted:**
- AI-01: Brain panel shipped as compact stats (threat%, patterns, insight) instead of original "live diary" concept — adjusted after user playtesting found callout text distracting
- MECH-03: Shipped 4 abilities instead of "at least 2" — exceeded requirement

**Dropped:**
- RET-02 (streak tracking): Deferred by user — daily challenge mode sufficient for v1
- RET-03 (streak rewards): Deferred by user — depends on RET-02
- RET-04 (streak ramp-down): Deferred by user — depends on RET-02
