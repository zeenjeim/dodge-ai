## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Single HTML file stays through Phase 2; Vite migration considered at Phase 3 if file exceeds ~4000 lines
- [Roadmap]: Analytics before retention (measure before optimizing)
- [Roadmap]: Share card ships with SEO/analytics in Phase 3 (AI commentary from Phase 2 powers it)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- AI adaptation speed calibration (Phase 2) requires empirical playtesting — no formula, must discover through iteration
- Brownfield codebase (~2800 lines single file) may resist modular changes in later phases
