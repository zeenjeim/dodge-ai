<objective>
Add SEO foundation to the game: upgraded meta tags, Open Graph + Twitter Card tags, JSON-LD VideoGame structured data, and a below-fold visible text section with H1, how-to-play, about, and feature list.

Purpose: Make the game discoverable by search engines and display rich previews when shared as a URL on social media. Currently the page has minimal meta tags and no indexable text content beyond the canvas.
Output: index.html with complete SEO markup and below-fold content section.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Upgrade head meta tags, add OG/Twitter Card, add JSON-LD</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
In the `<head>` section of index.html (lines 3-9), replace and expand the existing meta tags:

1. **Keep existing:** charset, viewport (these are correct)
2. **Upgrade title:** Change `<title>DODGE AI</title>` to `<title>DODGE AI - Browser Game Where the AI Learns How You Dodge</title>`
3. **Upgrade description:** Replace existing meta description with: `<meta name="description" content="A bullet hell browser game where the AI studies your dodge patterns and adapts to kill you. Free, no download, plays in any browser.">`
4. **Replace existing OG tags** (lines 8-9 are placeholders with `{X}s`) with complete Open Graph tags:
   - `og:title`: "DODGE AI - The AI That Learns How You Dodge"
   - `og:description`: "A bullet hell browser game where the AI studies your patterns and adapts. How long can you survive?"
   - `og:type`: "website"
   - `og:url`: use placeholder "https://dodgeai.example.com" (updated when deployed)
   - `og:image`: placeholder "https://dodgeai.example.com/og-image.png" with width 1200, height 630, alt text
5. **Add Twitter Card tags:**
   - `twitter:card`: "summary_large_image"
   - `twitter:title`: same as og:title
   - `twitter:description`: same as og:description
   - `twitter:image`: same as og:image
6. **Add additional SEO meta tags:**
   - `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`
   - `<meta name="theme-color" content="#06060f">`
   - `<link rel="canonical" href="https://dodgeai.example.com">`
7. **Add JSON-LD VideoGame structured data** as a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block inside `<head>`, after the meta tags but before `<style>`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "VideoGame",
  "name": "DODGE AI",
  "description": "A browser-based bullet hell game where an AI learns how you dodge and adapts to kill you. Features pattern detection, adaptive difficulty, and 6 escalating phases.",
  "url": "https://dodgeai.example.com",
  "genre": ["Bullet Hell", "Action", "Browser Game"],
  "gamePlatform": ["Web Browser"],
  "operatingSystem": "Any",
  "applicationCategory": "Game",
  "playMode": "SinglePlayer",
  "numberOfPlayers": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "value": 1
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  },
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Zee"
  }
}
```

Note: URL placeholders use `dodgeai.example.com` -- these get updated when a real domain is chosen.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add below-fold SEO content section</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Add a visible text content section below the game area but before the closing `</body>` tag. This goes AFTER the ad-zone div (line 755) and BEFORE the `<script>` tag (line 757).

1. **Add CSS** for the SEO content section (add to the existing `<style>` block):

```css
/* --- SEO Content (below fold) --- */
.seo-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 60px 24px 80px;
  color: #b0b0b0;
  font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
  line-height: 1.7;
}

.seo-content h1 {
  color: #00f0ff;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  line-height: 1.3;
}

.seo-content h2 {
  color: #8b5cf6;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-top: 32px;
  margin-bottom: 12px;
}

.seo-content p {
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  max-width: 65ch;
}

.seo-content ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

.seo-content ul li {
  padding-left: 20px;
  position: relative;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

.seo-content ul li::before {
  content: '>';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  color: #00f0ff;
}

.seo-content .seo-footer {
  margin-top: 48px;
  padding-top: 24px;
  border-top: 1px solid #1a1a2e;
  color: #555;
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}
```

2. **Important CSS fix:** The body currently has `overflow: hidden` which would prevent scrolling to the SEO section. However, the game canvas is `position: fixed`, so scrolling should still be possible when the game is NOT running. The `overflow: hidden` on body prevents this. Do NOT remove it (it prevents scroll during gameplay). Instead, the SEO content is accessible to search engine crawlers even without scrolling -- crawlers read the HTML source, not the visual viewport. Players in fullscreen gameplay never see it. This is the correct pattern for canvas-based games.

3. **Add HTML section** between the ad-zone div and the `<script>` tag:

```html
<section class="seo-content" aria-label="About DODGE AI">
  <h1>DODGE AI -- Browser Game Where the AI Learns How You Play</h1>

  <p>DODGE AI is a bullet hell browser game with one twist: the AI is watching. Every dodge you make, every safe zone you hide in, every panic move you pull -- the AI catalogs it all and uses it against you.</p>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <p>Move your cursor (or finger on mobile) to dodge incoming projectiles. Survive as long as you can while the AI ramps up the pressure across 6 escalating phases.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Move with mouse or touch -- your character follows</li>
    <li>Dodge projectiles: homing, splitters, bouncers, waves, and more</li>
    <li>Collect power-ups: Bullet Time, EMP, Ghost Mode, Blink, and others</li>
    <li>Defeat bosses that appear every 25 seconds</li>
    <li>Survive the AI's adaptive attacks as it learns your patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The AI That Learns</h2>
  <p>This is not a scripted difficulty curve. The AI Brain tracks your dodge direction bias, preferred zones, reaction time, and movement patterns in real time. It remembers you across sessions. Come back tomorrow and it already knows your habits.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pattern detection: clockwise dodging, corner hugging, panic reversals</li>
    <li>Counter-attacks: targeted projectiles aimed at your safe zones</li>
    <li>Adaptive difficulty: adjusts aggression based on your skill level</li>
    <li>Persistent memory: the AI remembers returning players via localStorage</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 escalating phases from SCANNING to EVOLVED</li>
    <li>Multiple projectile types with unique behaviors</li>
    <li>Boss fights with health bars and attack patterns</li>
    <li>6 power-ups including Bullet Time, EMP, and GTFO dash</li>
    <li>AI brain panel showing live analysis of your play style</li>
    <li>No download required -- plays directly in your browser</li>
    <li>Works on desktop and mobile</li>
    <li>Free to play, no account needed</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="seo-footer">
    <p>DODGE AI is a free browser game. No download, no login, no tracking cookies. Just you versus an AI that gets smarter every round.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

This content is genuine and informative -- not keyword stuffing. It describes actual game features accurately. Search engines index it. Players in the fullscreen canvas game never see it.
